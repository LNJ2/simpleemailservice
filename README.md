# Searchmetrics Simple Email Service

![header](header.png)

This RESTful service can send E-Mails with attachments using an AWS API. If you
want you can also first upload your attachments to a S3 bucket and only add a
link to it in your E-Mail.

You can find the documentation and some examples how to use it
[here](doc/simple-email-service_api.md).
